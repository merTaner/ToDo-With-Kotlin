# Kotlin Todo App

### Goals

- Create a basic Kotlin Android application to learn the fundamentals of Android development.
- Connect the todo app to Firebase for data persistence and synchronization.

### Tech Stack

- Kotlin: A modern programming language developed by JetBrains specifically for Android development, known for its conciseness, safety, and interoperability with Java.

- Firebase: Google's suite of backend-as-a-service (BaaS) tools used for building mobile and web applications. In this project, we will leverage Firebase Realtime Database for storing and managing todo items.

### Here's a breakdown of the functionalities

Users can add new tasks by a title.

Users can view a list of their tasks.

Users can mark the task as completed.

Users can delete tasks.

All task data is synchronized with Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring data persistence and accessibility across devices.
